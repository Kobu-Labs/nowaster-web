# Community Features Planning

## Core Concept
Communities will track specific tags and categories. When members create sessions with those tags/categories, the time is tracked both individually and at the community level.

**Example**: "Faculty of Informatics" community with course categories. Student sessions in those courses contribute to both personal and community metrics.

## Community Types
- **Invite-only** or **Public** communities
- **Public data** or **Member-only** data visibility
- **Role-based management** for members and associated tags/categories

## Feature Ideas

### Core Community Features
- **Community Templates**: Pre-built templates for common use cases (universities, coding bootcamps, fitness groups, book clubs)
- **Nested Communities**: Sub-communities within larger ones (departments within faculties, teams within organizations)
- **Community Discovery**: Browse/search public communities by category, tags, or activity level
- **Copying Community Templates**: Replicate existing community structure (e.g., school timetables)

### Engagement & Gamification
- **User Leaderboards**: Members with most time in given sessions
- **Achievement Badges**: Custom badges for milestones (first 10 hours, consistency streaks, category mastery)
- **Team Challenges**: Time-based competitions between community members or sub-groups
- **Study/Work Streaks**: Track consecutive days of activity in community categories
- **Peer Recognition**: Members can give kudos/awards to others for achievements

### Analytics & Insights
- **Community Dashboard**: Aggregate stats, trending categories, most active periods
- **Progress Comparison**: Anonymous comparison with community averages
- **Time Distribution Charts**: See how the community allocates time across categories
- **Activity Heatmaps**: Visual representation of when the community is most active

### Collaboration Features
- **Study Groups/Sessions**: Coordinate synchronized work sessions with other members
- **Resource Sharing**: Share useful links, documents, or tips related to community categories
- **Community Calendar**: Shared events, deadlines, or milestones
- **Mentorship Matching**: Connect experienced members with newcomers

### Management & Moderation
- **Role-based Permissions**: Different roles for managing members and associated tags/categories
- **Automated Moderation**: Auto-flag suspicious time entries or spammy behavior
- **Community Guidelines**: Custom rules and enforcement tools
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass invite users, bulk category management
- **Analytics Export**: Export community data for external analysis

### Social Features
- **Activity Feed**: Recent achievements, milestones, and community updates
- **Member Spotlight**: Feature top contributors or interesting member stories
- **Discussion Forums**: Category-specific or general community discussions

## Implementation Considerations
- Database schema for community relationships
- Permission system for different access levels
- API endpoints for community management
- UI components for community discovery and management
- Real-time updates for collaborative features
